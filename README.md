# Xusix Theme for Mastodon

Install the theme by copying the files from `app/javascript/styles/` into the same path in your Mastodon installation. Also update the `config/themes.yml` file to include the `styles/xusix.scss` entry as shown in this repo.

If running in Docker, rebuilding the container with the new source is required for the changes to be reflected.
